  - Split PDF pages into a new document
  - Decrypt input as necessary (password required)
  - Encrypt output as desired
  - Fill PDF Forms with FDF Data and/or Flatten Forms
  - Apply a Background Watermark
  - Report PDF on metrics, including metadata and bookmarks
  - Update PDF Metadata
  - Attach Files to PDF Pages or the PDF Document
  - Unpack PDF Attachments
  - Burst a PDF document into single pages
  - Uncompress and re-compress page streams
  - Repair corrupted PDF (where possible)
